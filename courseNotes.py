POINTS          RECURSION   ITERATION
Space efficient? No          Yes         No stack memory require in case of iteration
Time efficient?  No          Yes         In case of recursion system needs more time for pop and push elements to stack memory which makes recursion less time efficient.
Easy to code?   Yes         NO           We use recursion specially in the cases we known that a problem can be solved by breaking it into smaller problems.
"""
# When to Use/avoid Recursion
"""
When to use it?
1. When a problem can be solved by breaking it into smaller problems.
2. When we are fine with the extra overhead that comes with it.
3. When we need a quick working solution instead of a more efficient one.
4. When traverse a tree or graph.
5. When we use memoization in recursion. "Memoization is a technique to store the result of a function call so that we donâ€™t have to calculate it again."
When avoid it?
1. If time ans space complexity is a matters for us.
2. Recursion uses more memory. If we use embedded memory. For example, an application that runs on a mobile phone.
3. Recursion can be slow.
